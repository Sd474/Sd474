##### Hi there, I'm Soumik 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Data Science undergrad who's passionate about solving real-world problems with clean code, smart models, and a good dose of curiosity.



💻 About Me

- 🧠 Pythonic thinker – I love working with data, automating workflows, and building ML models.
- 🧪 Currently experimenting with machine learning, data pipelines, and model optimization.
- 🏆 Active on [Kaggle]((https://www.kaggle.com/soumikdey442)) – competing, learning, and sharing notebooks.
- 📊 I enjoy turning raw data into clear insights and useful solutions.
- 🛠 Tools of the trade: `Python`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `NumPy`.



🚀 Projects

Here are a few cool things I’ve worked on:

- 🛰 Spaceship Titanic ML Model
  Cleaned, trained, and optimized multiple ML models to predict transport status on a fictional space mission.  
  Achieved "80.4% accuracy" on Kaggle 🚀

AND OF COURSE THERE'S STILL MORE TO COME IN THE FUTURE!!!!!!!!!!!

 ✨ Fun Fact

I love blending old-school vibes with new-school tech. Whether it's a Pandas DataFrame or a retro game, I’m always up for exploring and building cool stuff.
